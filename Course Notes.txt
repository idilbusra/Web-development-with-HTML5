What is HTML?
• HTML is the abbreviation of Hyper Text Markup Language.
• HTML commands allow content such as text, images, audio, video to
be placed on the page and displayed to the visitor.
• One of the most important features of HTML is links, which allow
us to go from one part of the page to another or to another page.

HTML Commands
• HTML language consists of commands called tags or tags.
• These commands come together to create the web/html page.
• If you right-click on a web page and run the "View source"
command, you can see the HTML codes that make up the page.

HTML Page
• The file extension of HTML pages is .htm or .html.
• Even if there is no HTML code in the file you create, if you save the file with the .html extension, that file will still become an HTML page.
• If you double-click on the web page you created, it will open with the default browser on your computer.

Who is the Inventor of HTML?
• HTML language was developed in 1980 by Tim Berners-Lee, who worked at CERN laboratories.
• Lee's aim was to create a system so that researchers working at CERN could easily share their information
and documents.

HTML Versions
HTML, which started to be used in the CERN laboratory in 1980, has survived to the present day by adapting to current technologies with its new versions:
• ENQUIRE (1980, prototype)
• HTML 1 (1989)
• HTML 2 (1995)
• HTML 3.20 (1997)

What is Network (Web)?
• Computers connected to each other in any home or workplace form a network.
Such networks are called Local Area Network (LAN).
• Local networks are connected to each other to form wide networks (WAN), and large networks are connected to each other to form the World Wide Web (WWW), which is a worldwide network.

What is a Web Server?
• If you want other people to visit HTML pages, you should
put these pages on computers called Web Servers.

What is Hosting?
