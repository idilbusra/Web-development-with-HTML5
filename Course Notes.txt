What is HTML?
• HTML is the abbreviation of Hyper Text Markup Language.
• HTML commands allow content such as text, images, audio, video to
be placed on the page and displayed to the visitor.
• One of the most important features of HTML is links, which allow
us to go from one part of the page to another or to another page.

HTML Commands
• HTML language consists of commands called tags or tags.
• These commands come together to create the web/html page.
• If you right-click on a web page and run the "View source"
command, you can see the HTML codes that make up the page.

HTML Page
• The file extension of HTML pages is .htm or .html.
• Even if there is no HTML code in the file you create, if you save the file with the .html extension, that file will still become an HTML page.
• If you double-click on the web page you created, it will open with the default browser on your computer.

Who is the Inventor of HTML?
• HTML language was developed in 1980 by Tim Berners-Lee, who worked at CERN laboratories.
• Lee's aim was to create a system so that researchers working at CERN could easily share their information
and documents.
